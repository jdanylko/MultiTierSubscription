This post was written for the <a href="https://csadvent.christmas/">C# Advent</a> (#csadvent - 2022 Edition).

Code meant to compliment the post called 
<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/creating-multi-tier-subscriptions-using-c-T3">Creating Multi-Tier Subscriptions using C#</a>

The post introduces subscription-based plans, how to create a Feature Matrix for a product, and finally create a library for identifying
whether a user has access to a particular feature based on their subscription level.

I hope this provokes entrepreneurial developers to include this into their own real-world products.

Enjoy!
